# TicTacToe
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++ for the console. This game features a simple 3x3 grid where two players, 'X' and 'O', take turns making moves. The game continues until one player wins by getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full, resulting in a tie.
