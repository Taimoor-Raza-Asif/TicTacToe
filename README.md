# Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++ for the console. This game features a simple 3x3 grid where two players, 'X' and 'O', take turns making moves. The game continues until one player wins by getting three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## Features

- **Player Switching:** Players take turns making moves, and the game alternates between 'X' and 'O'.
- **Win Checker:** The game checks for a win after each move, ensuring the victory condition is met.
- **Game Over Detection:** Detects when the game is over due to either a win or a tie.
- **Input Validation:** Validates user input to ensure it corresponds to a valid move on the board.
- **Clear Console:** Utilizes `system("cls")` to clear the console for a smoother gameplay experience.
